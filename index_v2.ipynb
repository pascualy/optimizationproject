    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As the effects of global warming become increasingly apparent, people are considering living off the grid. Living off the grid means that you do not rely on public utilities for utilities like electricity, running water, sewer, natural gas, or heat, but rather you create your own energy. Currently, most people take a hybrid approach meaning that they utilize small capacity renewable energy products while still utilizing some public utilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For many Americans, the deciding factor to transition to low-carbon electricity is that the cost of energy from these products must be cheaper than the energy produced by the grid coupled with the environmental impact associated with the implementation.  In the past, the cost of renewable energy products was very expensive making it financially impractical to make the transition due to high initial costs for the equipment. Over time, the financial benefit of renewable energy products can save a substantial amount of money on utilities while vastly decreasing the impact on the environment. Just a decade ago, it was much cheaper to build a new coal-burning power plant than it was to build a large capacity wind or solar plant. Since then, the price per MWh has declined by 89% for large capacity renewable energy sources which has trickled down into the smaller capacity renewable energy product market (Roser, 2020)1. Recently, reductions in the initial cost of renewable energy products have been spurred on by improvements in manufacturing processes and advances in technology which have made living off the grid more accessible to a wider range of income levels. As of 2017, approximately 180,000 families live off the grid which is expected to significantly increase every year (Infoplease, 2020)2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to assist Americans considering living off the grid. We plan to develop a tool to help minimize the overall cost associated with off-grid products for a family’s energy needs based on the energy resources available. Depending on their location, people can input variables into the tool, such as average monthly electricity and heat demand, initial and monthly budget, and costs associated with renewable energy products and grid information. Based on these parameters, the tool will output the best combination of products (including utilizing the grid) and the optimal number of units of each product to meet demand while minimizing financial and environmental costs.
