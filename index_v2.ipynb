    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As the effects of global warming become increasingly apparent, people are considering living off the grid. Living off the grid means that you do not rely on public utilities for utilities like electricity, running water, sewer, natural gas, or heat, but rather you create your own energy. Currently, most people take a hybrid approach meaning that they utilize small capacity renewable energy products while still utilizing some public utilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For many Americans, the deciding factor to transition to low-carbon electricity is that the cost of energy from these products must be cheaper than the energy produced by the grid coupled with the environmental impact associated with the implementation.  In the past, the cost of renewable energy products was very expensive making it financially impractical to make the transition due to high initial costs for the equipment. Over time, the financial benefit of renewable energy products can save a substantial amount of money on utilities while vastly decreasing the impact on the environment. Just a decade ago, it was much cheaper to build a new coal-burning power plant than it was to build a large capacity wind or solar plant. Since then, the price per MWh has declined by 89% for large capacity renewable energy sources which has trickled down into the smaller capacity renewable energy product market (Roser, 2020)1. Recently, reductions in the initial cost of renewable energy products have been spurred on by improvements in manufacturing processes and advances in technology which have made living off the grid more accessible to a wider range of income levels. As of 2017, approximately 180,000 families live off the grid which is expected to significantly increase every year (Infoplease, 2020)2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to assist Americans considering living off the grid. We plan to develop a tool to help minimize the overall cost associated with off-grid products for a familyâ€™s energy needs based on the energy resources available. Depending on their location, people can input variables into the tool, such as average monthly electricity and heat demand, initial and monthly budget, and costs associated with renewable energy products and grid information. Based on these parameters, the tool will output the best combination of products (including utilizing the grid) and the optimal number of units of each product to meet demand while minimizing financial and environmental costs.

    "## 2. Background\n",
    "####  Demand\n",
    "This off-grid housing energy optimization problem starts first with energy demand data. We chose to use electric, hourly demand data over the course of the year in units of kwh (kilowatt-hours). This data was procured from << website/source? >> which gives total grid energy consumption for various regions of the United States. Using information on the percent breakdown of residential energy usage from the grid, and census data on the population of the region, we derived an average hourly energy consumption metric per household, per hour, for every hour of a standard 365 day calendar year, using the readily available data for year 2020 (removing February 29th since 2020 is a leap year). This estimation method aligned closely with the total estimated energy consumption per household from << EIA - US Energy Information Administration >>, so we decided this was an adequate metric to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "<< we can insert an equation here to represent the math if we want >>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the average hourly electricity demand for each day was utilized in the model to capture the changes in demand during different seasons and for different parts of the country with different weather patterns. The user interface in this notebook allows the user to choose from a few predefined locations in a drop-down list which capture demand data from different regions of the United States. Users can also procure and upload their own demand data in the format required for the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we provide a feature which allows you to choose the times of year to consider demand data for your home. For a full time resident, this would be the full year. However, if this off-grid house is a summer vacation home or a winter vacation home, that may change your energy demand needs. As a result, the recommended product suggestions output from our model will change according to this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<< insert some sample graphs/charts of demand data from somewhere showing a seasonal pattern >>\n",
    "\n",
    "A complementary set of data required to supplement this energy demand data is data describing the efficiency of different energy generation products based on location in the world. The efficiency of solar and wind can vary greatly based on the time of year, the amount of sunlight a region recieves, temperature, and local weather patterns for that area. We acquired data on the efficiency of solar power and wind power from <<< website here >> which allows an input of any city, and in return provides hourly efficiency data. This data is used in the optimization to understand the optimal mix of energy products to support your home, depending on the location of your home. \n",
    "\n",
    "<< insert visuals on efficiency data, if we want to >>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supply \n",
    "In our optimization model, the supply of energy to meet the demand comes from several possible power sources. These can first be divided by on-grid and off-grid power sources. Within off-grid power sources, we have energy generation products and energy storage products. The two types of energy generation products wind and solar power. The table below defines the mix of products we chose to input in to our model, so the output of the model provides an optimal combination of these power sources that meets energy demand and other constraints, while minimizing cost to the resident.   \n",

    "\n",
    "Each of these products is defined with a max amount of energy that it can provide in the units of kwh (kilowatt-hours). This is defined in a configuration CSV file which can be uploaded by the user for custom products they would like to consider. Each power generation product (solar and wind) has a maximum capacity in kwh, which is multipled by an efficiency metric mentioned in the demand section above. This provides the expected hourly power generation in kwh of each product over every hour of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy generation products and storage products interact directly with each other. \"Storage\" products here are batteries, and then can be used to store excess energy generated, or they can be used to meet the energy demand of the customer. Our system is set up so that excess energy generated on a daily basis from wind and solar products can be stored indefinitely and used for other days when demand is higher. We operate under the assumptions that you would not pull energy from the grid and store it on your batteries, and that the intention of using battery energy is to minimze the amount of on-grid energy consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a household's ability to satisfy demand requirements is a combination of their energy generation products and their storage products, the output of our tool is a suggestion on number of products recommended for the user to buy from the list given in Table 1 above.   \n",

    "- **\"Unit Cost\"**: The cost per unit of a product, such as a solar panel or a wind turbine, that is incurred once per unit at the time of initial purchase.\n",
